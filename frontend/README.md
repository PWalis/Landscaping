# An Overview

The vision of this landscaping web application is to showcase the portfolio and services of 'Isia Landscaping' for interested prospective
clients. Currently, Isia does not have a website for his landscaping business. The web is virtual real estate and a well-designed
website is a large part of showcasing one's reputable business ventures. The website offers a quick, easy overview for
a prospect to gain an understanding of doing business with an organization. The other importance of the website is tasked with
self-scheduling clients, giving the client the ability to choose their service package on their time and effectively automating the process.

The web application will prove to be a valuable asset for the company.

# Landing Page
The intended effect of the landing page is to offer the customer a taste of exactly what the vision of Isia's Landscaping is: Excellent yardwork services.
To produce this result, the main background is a photo of a nice, well maintained Arizona residency. There are two call-to-action buttons
strategically and diagonally placed, offering a quick objective for the achievement of the website (Scheduling an Appointment).
